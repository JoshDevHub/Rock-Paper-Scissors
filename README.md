# Rock Paper Scissors #

This is a project done as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

How the game works:
- Runs a game of rock, paper, scissors in the browser.
- User clicks on buttons to make a choice. The user's choice goes up against a random selection made by the program.
- The game is played until either the user or the computer has accumulated 5 wins, when an overall winner is determined.

## Low Priority TODO

Low priority because I want to move on in the course but could be fun rainy Saturday work. 

* [ ] Animate the Modal
* [ ] Animate the RPS button icons (bounce/bob effect?)
* [ ] Computer choice is highlighted on the button.
* [ ] More decorative scoring section.
* [ ] Log of the moves throughout the game displayed in the modal.
* [ ] Make more responsive. Layout breaks down on smaller mobile screens.

## Special Thanks

To the folks at The Odin Project for their web development course.
