# Rock Paper Scissors #

This is a project done as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

How the game works:
- Runs a game of rock, paper, scissors through the browser console.
- User is prompted for input and plays against the "computer", which selects among rock, paper, and scissors at random.
- The game is played best out of 5 rounds. The first player to win 3 rounds wins the game.

## TODO

## Special Thanks

To the folks at The Odin Project for their web development course.
